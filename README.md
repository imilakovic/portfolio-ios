# Portfolio iOS

Portfolio is an application designed primarily to showcase my iOS development skills.

It should also serve a purpose as an interactive résumé with 6 sections:
1. Apps
2. Controls
3. Experience
4. Education
5. Language
6. Contact

Have fun browsing and I hope you will enjoy it!

**Important:**
Please note that applications presented in the Portfolio were developed for my clients. I do not own concepts or designs of those applications - I was responsible for iOS development exclusively.
